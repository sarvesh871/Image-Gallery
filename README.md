# 📸 AI Photo Gallery Website

A modern serverless AI-powered photo gallery built on AWS. Users can upload images directly to Amazon S3 using pre-signed URLs, where every uploaded image is automatically analyzed using Amazon Rekognition. The detected labels are stored in Amazon DynamoDB and displayed in a responsive gallery with search functionality.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete event-driven serverless architecture using AWS services together with a modern React frontend.

# ⚙ System Workflow

1. User selects an image.
2. Frontend requests a pre-signed upload URL.
3. Upload URL Lambda generates the URL.
4. Browser uploads the image directly to Amazon S3.
5. S3 triggers the Process Image Lambda.
6. Process Image Lambda calls Amazon Rekognition.
7. Rekognition detects labels in the image.
8. Image metadata is stored inside DynamoDB.
9. Gallery Lambda retrieves the metadata.
10. Frontend displays the searchable gallery.

# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to the GitHub repository automatically triggers:

```
GitHub
    │
    ▼
AWS CodePipeline
    │
    ▼
AWS CodeBuild
